 **Overview**
 Russell Norgive is an AI-generated or AI-enhanced book that explores [briefly describe the genre, theme, or unique element of the book]. 
 This project combines artificial intelligence techniques with storytelling to [state the goal: e.g., generate compelling narratives, explore ethical themes, etc.].

**Technologies Used**
1:- OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT or Codex)
2:- Python (for automation and text processing)
3:- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**How AI Was Involved**
This book was written with the help of AI by:
Generating dialogue based on character traits
Proposing plot twists using prompt engineering
Editing and refining scenes using AI feedback loops

**How to Use**
You can read the chapters directly in the chapters/ folder, or run the scripts in ai-scripts/ to generate new content. Instructions are in each script file.
**Future Plans**
1:- Expand the story into a trilogy

2:- Use fine-tuning to tailor the AI model to a specific narrative voice

3:- Add interactive features (like a chatbot version of Russell)

**This project was created for experimental and creative purposes. AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies or unintended interpretations**
